# Using Data to Power the Grid: A Case Study of a Hydroelectric Utility Company

## The "Why"
Access to electricity is essential as its woven into nearly every aspect of our lives. Consumers use electricity in every second of every day, yet it is rare for people to consider where their power is coming from or how their power is generated. What would happen if consumers had to depend on unreliable energy? There could be a myriad of issues like traffic accidents, lapses in medical care, and a lack of stability in global economies. That's why it's important to ensure that all energy sources are sustainable and reliable. 

My team at Syracuse University was outsourced by a hydroelectric utility company to identify ways to improve operational efficiency at the companies' various hydro plants. The goal was to optimize power outages by predicting the ideal outage schedule that would result in maximizing revenue streams and minimizing costs. After further research, the team discovered many variables affecting the companies ability to supply affordable, reliable, and renewable energy. 

## About the Data 
Four main data sets, containing hourly records from 1999 to 2018, were provided by the hydroelectric utility company in Excel spreadsheet format.

## Outcome 
New York State is often recognized for its high-quality public education. Yet, income and access stand between students and their entrance to specialized high schools. Disparities in income become even clearer when comparing students by race and ethnicity. 1,272 NYC schools were analyzed to identify trends in student academic performance as indicated by state assessments. These scores were compared based on the percentage of economically disadvantaged students at a given school and the school communitiesâ€™ average household income. The following trends were identified:

* Schools with more Black and Hispanic or Latino Students and English Language Learners have a higher ENI and lower average school income estimates.

* Schools with more White Students have a lower ENI and higher average school income estimates.

* Student performance is strongly correlated with race and income as White students had higher average scores on state-wide assessments and higher school income estimates.
	
An infographic was designed using Adobe Illustrator with visualizations created in R Studio that present the above information.
